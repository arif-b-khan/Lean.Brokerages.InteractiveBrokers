# Feature Specification: Interactive Brokers Data Download ToolBox Sample

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-data`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a data download for Interactive Brokers by adding a sample ToolBox console project modeled after Zerodha's QuantConnect.ZerodhaBrokerage.ToolBox that downloads historical data via the brokerage API and integrates with LEAN (CLI-compatible where feasible). Include commands, arguments, and sample code outline."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a LEAN/IB user, I want a sample ToolBox-style console app in this repository that
downloads historical data directly from Interactive Brokers, so that I can populate
local data for backtesting or analysis using a supported workflow similar to existing
brokerage ToolBox samples (e.g., Zerodha).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a configured IBKR account and valid credentials (via environment variables
   or config file), **When** I run the sample with symbol, resolution, and date range
   arguments, **Then** the app downloads historical bars from IB and writes them to a
   LEAN-compatible data folder structure with progress and error logs.
2. **Given** invalid or missing credentials, **When** I run the sample, **Then** the app
   exits non-zero with a clear error message and does not create partial/corrupt files.
3. **Given** an unsupported symbol or asset class, **When** I attempt to download, **Then**
   the app reports the incompatibility and suggests supported alternatives.
4. **Given** the `--help` flag, **When** I run the sample, **Then** CLI usage and argument
   descriptions are printed, including examples for equities and futures.

### Edge Cases

- IB session timeouts or rate limiting: the app retries with exponential backoff and
   surfaces a clear message if the backoff is exhausted.
- Partial-day trading sessions and holidays: the date range logic skips market-closed
   days and aligns bars to exchange sessions where possible.
- Network flakiness: transient errors are retried; persistent failures abort with a
   non-zero exit code and an actionable error.
- File system permissions: app validates write access to the target data root and fails
   early if not permitted.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repository MUST include a sample console project (e.g.,
   `QuantConnect.InteractiveBrokers.ToolBox`) that can download historical market data
   from IB using supported IBKR API methods.
- **FR-002**: The sample MUST accept CLI arguments for symbol (ticker), security type,
   exchange, currency, resolution (Tick/Second/Minute/Hour/Daily), and date range.
- **FR-003**: The sample MUST write output in LEAN-compatible data directory structure
   and file formats for the chosen resolution and asset class.
- **FR-004**: The sample MUST log progress, warnings, and errors, and return non-zero on
   fatal errors.
- **FR-005**: The sample MUST support authentication via environment variables and/or a
   config file (without logging secrets), and refuse to proceed when credentials are
   missing.
- **FR-006**: The sample SHOULD provide sensible defaults and a `--help` usage screen.
- **FR-007**: The sample SHOULD throttle or backoff to respect IB rate limits.
- **FR-008**: The sample MUST be consistent with the project Constitution (tests-first,
   observability, safety) and include at least a smoke test for CLI argument parsing.

*Ambiguities to clarify (tracked but not blocking the spec):*
  
- **FR-009**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact set of asset classes to support in v1
   (Equity/Futures/Forex/Options)?]
- **FR-010**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: precise LEAN data format variants for each asset
   class to output initially?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **DownloadRequest**: symbol, security type, exchange, currency, resolution, start/end
   dates, output root, throttle/backoff settings.
- **DownloadResult**: success flag, files written, warnings, error details.
- **CredentialSource**: environment variables and/or config file mapping to IB login or
   session tokens (redacted in logs).
- **OutputLayout**: helper for LEAN folder/filename mapping per asset class.
